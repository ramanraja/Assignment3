This project consists of the following three files:

* run_analysis.R
* TidySamsungData.txt
* CodeBook.md

run_analysis.R is the R script that created the output data. To run it, type the following command at the R console:

> source run_analysis.R

Ensure that the following input data files are in the current working directory before running the script:

* activity_labels.txt
* ColumnNames.txt
* features.txt
* subject_test.txt
* subject_train.txt
* X_test.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_test.txt
* y_train.txt

TidySamsungData.txt is the output tidy data file. It is a tab separated text file with 180 rows and 81 columns. Full description of this file can be found in the code book.

CodeBook.md is the code book for this data analysis project.

NOTE:
-----
An additional file, named features_info.txt is also included in the project for the sake of completeness. It provides additional details about the input data set. This file has been downloaded from the Coursera website for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.
